Hessle Cricket Club are one of the oldest clubs in the Yorkshire region. Founded in 1838 we are in our 2nd century of cricket and still going strong!

We run three senior teams on a Saturday/Sunday throughout the summer based at the picturesque Livingstone Road ground on the banks of the River Humber and in the shadow of the Humber Bridge.

We have a thriving junior set up where players of all ages, gender and abilities are encouraged to get involved in the wonderful game of cricket.  This includes the recently launched “ECB All Star Cricket” for 5 to 8 year olds which has added to our age ranges of 9 to 15 year olds.

The club continues to go from strength to strength and the generous support of local business sponsors have enabled us to invest in our infrastructure over recent years with such things as mobile covers, all weather pitches and practice nets, pitch preparation equipment and junior equipment.   These investments underpin our ambitions to develop and sustain both Senior and Junior cricket at Hessle for many years to come.  These investments have added to our excellent cricket square, scorebox and newly refurbished licensed clubhouse.

So, if you have a passion for local cricket played with a competitive spirit, but in a time honoured fashion, this is the place for you!

Come along and support your local club in this most special of years. Whether it’s on the playing front or as an enthusiastic supporter, we’d be happy to have you onboard.

Mark Rudston, Chairman, Hessle CC
