At Hessle Cricket Club we care passionately about the heritage and great traditions of our beloved sport. Hessle have their own long and proud history in this region and we aim for this to continue for many years to come.

To achieve this we have a simple vision:

* To promote and enjoy the game of cricket within the Hessle community by following some core principles
* Being competitive
* Provide a nurturing environment where talent and enthusiasm can flourish
* Develop and encourage players of all standards, ages, genders and abilities
* Encourage players to represent the club with decent behaviours that respect their team mates and the opposition

If you’re as passionate about cricket as us and have these principles at heart, come and join the our community, whether its to play or support.
